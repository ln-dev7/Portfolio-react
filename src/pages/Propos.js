            Hi,
                I am Leonel Ngoya often referred to as "LN".
                I am a young 17 year old student passionate about computer programming and more specifically the <span>frontend</span> side.
                I've been a coder for over a year now and think I'm good enough to run a project.
                <ButtonsBottom left={'/'} right={'/livinnow'} />
        </div>
    )
}

export default Propos;
